# COIL Explanatory Language (CEL)

CEL is a human-readable representation of COIL binary code. This is not a realy language as such though some compilers may implement this. CEL is a language used for explanations especially in the [standard section](./coil/std.md). You can safely ignore this for the most part if you are just building an assembler but it may help. A lot more code actually uses C especially for enumarations for its simple syntax and basic keyword structure. C is probably more important and knowing assembly won't hurt.

CEL is based on assembly syntax and most likely will be different from languages you know. Simple instructions that map directly to COIL which itself can map in some way or another to a native instruction.
