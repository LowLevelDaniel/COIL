# Computer Oriented Intermediate Language
Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL) is a binary language format made for computers sitting right above native binaries.

COIL has examples written in a pseudo code called CEL which is an imaginary langauge made for humans to view COIL code and read examples without having to decode binary.

More information on the complete COIL specification in [COIL Overview](./coil/OVERVIEW.md)

More information on the pseudo CEL language specification in [CEL Grammar Specifcation](./CEL-GRAMMAR.md)

Contributors should read the [Contributing Section](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [VERSION Control Section](./VERSION.md)

And for any users of COIL either compilers targeting or attempts at making COIL assemblers take a look at the [license](./LICENSE)

## The team behind COIL
The Low Level Team (LLT) is a relatively small team of like minded open source developers who wish to create an entirely new way to interact with technology from the ground up. Starting with languages LLT will go on to create operating systems browsers, graphic libraries, game engines and so much more. Most members of LLT are mostly anonymous the ones which are public you can probably find on github. LLT does not search for recognition but for open source control of the future.
