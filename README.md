# Computer Oriented Intermediate Language
COIL is a binary language format designed to be an optimal intermediate representation sitting just above native binaries. It aims to combine the benefits of low-level control with architecture independence and optimization opportunities.

## Core Benefits
- Direct mapping to native code while maintaining portability
- Minimal abstraction overhead
- Explicit optimization opportunities
- No runtime dependencies

## Project Structure
- `/coil/` - Core specifications and documentation

## Versioning
COIL follows a strict versioning scheme defined in [VERSION.md](./VERSION.md)

## Roadmap to 1.0.0
- [x] Initial specification
- [ ] Complete ISA definition
- [ ] Reference assembler
- [ ] Standard library implementation
- [ ] Test suite

## Related Projects
[Any complementary tools or libraries]

## The Low Level Team
The Low Level Team (LLT) is a relatively small team of like minded open source developers who wish to create an entirely new way to interact with technology from the ground up. Starting with languages LLT will go on to create operating systems browsers, graphic libraries, game engines and so much more. Most members of LLT are mostly anonymous the ones which are public you can probably find on github. LLT does not search for recognition but for open source control of the future.
