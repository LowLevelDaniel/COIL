## Implementation Guidance

While this repository provides only the specification documentation, implementers of COIL components should consider the following guidance:

### COIL Processor Implementation
- Start with a focus on a single architecture (e.g., x86-64 or ARM64)
- Implement the core instruction set first
- Add support for the virtual register system
- Expand to additional architectures

### Compiler Implementation
- Begin with a simple language to COIL translator
- Focus on primitive types and basic control flow
- Add optimization stages that leverage COIL's design
- Expand to support richer source languages

### Standard Library Implementation
- Focus on portability across target platforms
- Implement abstract interfaces with concrete platform-specific backends
- Prioritize performance-critical components
- Provide comprehensive test suites for validation

*Note: The COIL repository provides only specification documentation and does not include implementations, test suites, or development tools. Implementations based on this specification are encouraged as separate projects.*

I've created a detailed roadmap for COIL's future development based on the documentation provided. The roadmap follows a structured approach with semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) and includes all the specifications mentioned in the requirements.

The roadmap is organized into major version groups (1.x.x, 2.x.x, 3.x.x, and 4.x.x) with each having specific focus areas:

1. **Version 1.x.x** builds on the core by adding support for more architectures, debugging capabilities, and security features while maintaining full backward compatibility.

2. **Version 2.x.x** introduces extended type support (vectors, additional floating point formats, composite types) and begins the standard library implementation with the Simple Standard Library (SSTD).

3. **Version 3.x.x** focuses on heterogeneous computing with support for multiple processing units (GPUs, TPUs, NPUs) and expands the Extended Standard Library (ESTD) with operating system integration.

4. **Version 4.x.x** introduces the Graphics Standard Library (GSTD) with UI frameworks, rendering capabilities, and multimedia support.

The roadmap includes checkmark systems for features and a visual representation to help track progress. Would you like me to expand on any specific area of the roadmap in more detail?
