# COIL Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development trajectory for the Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL) specification, breaking down short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals to provide a clear path from our current pre-alpha state to a mature, feature-complete specification.

## Version 0.x.x (Pre-1.0.0) - Foundation Phase

- Extended platform-specific optimizations
- Prepare for 2.0.0 transitions

## Version 2.x.x - Expansion Phase

Version 2.0.0 marks a significant expansion in COIL's capabilities, particularly in its type system.

### Version 2.0.0
- Composite types (structures, unions)
- Array support
- Advanced memory models
- Object-oriented features
- Enhanced optimization capabilities
- Complete rewrite of type system

### Version 2.1.0

## Version 3.x.x - Next Generation Phase

Version 3.0.0 represents COIL's evolution into a comprehensive platform for multi-architecture, multi-paradigm computing.

### Version 3.0.0
- Multi-processing unit coordination
- Support for specialized accelerators (GPU, TPU, NPU)
- Advanced heterogeneous computing models
- Hardware-specific optimization pathways
- Complete restructuring of configuration system

### Future Directions
- Quantum computing extensions
- Analog computing support
- Neuromorphic computing integration
- Advanced AI acceleration capabilities
- Novel computing paradigm support

## Implementation Priorities

For each version milestone, the following components should be prioritized:

1. Specification documentation
2. Test suite development
3. Reference implementation
4. Optimization strategies
5. Compatibility verification
6. Tooling and ecosystem

## Compatibility Considerations

The roadmap adheres to the versioning policy outlined in VERSION.md:
- No breaking changes within the same major version
- Pre-1.0.0 versions may include breaking changes in minor versions
- All breaking changes must be clearly documented
- Deprecation periods before removal of features

## Development Process

For each milestone:
1. Draft specifications for review
2. Community feedback period (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Refinement based on feedback
4. Final specification publication
5. Reference implementation development
6. Test suite expansion
7. Release and documentation updates

This roadmap will be revisited and updated as development progresses and new requirements or opportunities emerge.
