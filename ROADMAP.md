# COIL Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development trajectory for the Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL) specification, breaking down short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals to provide a clear path from our current pre-alpha state to a mature, feature-complete specification.

## Version 0.x.x (Pre-1.0.0) - Foundation Phase

The pre-1.0.0 releases focus on establishing core functionality while maintaining flexibility for architecture changes.

### Version 0.1.0
- Initial ISA specification with fundamental instructions
- Define fixed-width primitive types (integers, floats)
- Establish virtual register system for x86 architecture
- Document basic directives for assembly control
- Define minimal binary format for COF and NCOF
- Create configuration file format specification

### Version 0.2.0
- Add ARM support to virtual register system
- Complete memory model specification
- Finalize instruction encoding rules
- Define binary compatibility guarantees

### Version 0.3.0
- Complete ABI integration for major operating systems
- Establish specification for debugging information
- Finalize error handling model

### Version 0.4.0
- Complete optimization level definitions
- Finalize linker directives
- Establish security model and guarantees

### Version 0.5.0
- Complete binary format stability guarantees
- Release candidate for 1.0.0
- Complete documentation for all core components
- Final breaking changes before 1.0.0

## Version 1.0.0 - Core Specification Release

Version 1.0.0 represents the first stable release of the COIL specification with strong backward compatibility guarantees moving forward. The focus is on providing a solid foundation with basic assembly-like functionality found in most common ISAs.

### Version 1.0.0 Features
- Stable ISA with basic instruction set (arithmetic, control flow, data movement)
- Stable binary format for COF and NCOF
- Complete documentation for the core specification
- Support for primitive types (integers, floating-point)
- Virtual register system for common architectures (x86-64, ARM)
- Basic ABI integration for common platforms
- Simple, consistent instruction encoding format
- No standard library dependency

## Version 2.x.x - Extended Functionality Phase

Version 2.0.0 marks a significant expansion in COIL's capabilities, introducing more advanced features while maintaining backward compatibility with 1.0.0.

### Version 2.0.0
- Composite types (structures, unions)
- Array support
- Vector/SIMD operations
- Advanced memory models
- Simple Standard Library (SSTD)
- Extended optimization capabilities

### Version 2.1.0
- Extended Standard Library (ESTD)
- Heterogeneous computing support (preliminary)
- Advanced vector operations
- Enhanced parallel processing capabilities
- Cross-architecture optimization

### Version 2.2.0
- Graphics Standard Library (GSTD)
- Just-in-time compilation support
- Dynamic code generation
- Runtime optimization capabilities

## Version 3.x.x - Next Generation Phase

Version 3.0.0 represents COIL's evolution into a comprehensive platform for multi-architecture, multi-paradigm computing.

### Version 3.0.0
- Multi-processing unit coordination
- Support for specialized accelerators (GPU, TPU, NPU)
- Advanced heterogeneous computing models
- Hardware-specific optimization pathways
- Complete restructuring of configuration system

### Future Directions
- Quantum computing extensions
- Analog computing support
- Neuromorphic computing integration
- Advanced AI acceleration capabilities
- Novel computing paradigm support

## Documentation Development Process

For each milestone:
1. Draft specifications for review
2. Community feedback period (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Refinement based on feedback
4. Final specification publication

This roadmap will be revisited and updated as the specification development progresses and new requirements or opportunities emerge.

*Note: The COIL repository provides only the specification documentation and does not include implementations, test suites, or direct development tools. Implementations based on this specification are encouraged as separate projects.*
