# COIL Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development trajectory for the Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL) specification, breaking down completed milestones and future goals to provide a clear path from our current version 1.0.0 to future feature-complete specifications.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This roadmap describes the planned evolution of the COIL specification documentation. It does not represent implementation code, tools, or test suites, which would be developed as separate projects.

## Version 1.0.0 - Core Specification Release (CURRENT)

Version 1.0.0 represents the first stable release of the COIL specification with strong backward compatibility guarantees moving forward. The focus is on providing a solid foundation with basic assembly-like functionality found in most common ISAs.

### Version 1.0.0 Features (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Stable ISA with basic instruction set (arithmetic, control flow, data movement)
- ✅ Stable binary format for COF and NCOF
- ✅ Complete documentation for the core specification
- ✅ Support for primitive types (integers, floating-point)
- ✅ Virtual register system for common architectures (x86-64, ARM)
- ✅ Basic ABI integration for common platforms
- ✅ Simple, consistent instruction encoding format
- ✅ No standard library dependency

## Version 2.x.x - Extended Functionality Phase

Version 2.0.0 will mark a significant expansion in COIL's capabilities, introducing more advanced features while maintaining backward compatibility with 1.0.0.

### Version 2.0.0 (PLANNED)
- Composite types (structures, unions)
- Array support
- Vector/SIMD operations
- Advanced memory models
- Simple Standard Library (SSTD)
- Extended optimization capabilities

### Version 2.1.0 (PLANNED)
- Extended Standard Library (ESTD)
- Heterogeneous computing support (preliminary)
- Advanced vector operations
- Enhanced parallel processing capabilities
- Cross-architecture optimization

### Version 2.2.0 (PLANNED)
- Graphics Standard Library (GSTD)
- Just-in-time compilation support
- Dynamic code generation
- Runtime optimization capabilities

## Version 3.x.x - Next Generation Phase

Version 3.0.0 will represent COIL's evolution into a comprehensive platform for multi-architecture, multi-paradigm computing.

### Version 3.0.0 (PLANNED)
- Multi-processing unit coordination
- Support for specialized accelerators (GPU, TPU, NPU)
- Advanced heterogeneous computing models
- Hardware-specific optimization pathways
- Complete restructuring of configuration system

### Future Directions (PLANNED)
- Quantum computing extensions
- Analog computing support
- Neuromorphic computing integration
- Advanced AI acceleration capabilities
- Novel computing paradigm support

## Documentation Development Process

For each milestone:
1. Draft specifications for review
2. Community feedback period (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Refinement based on feedback
4. Final specification publication

This roadmap will be revisited and updated as the specification development progresses and new requirements or opportunities emerge.

## Implementation Guidance

While this repository provides only the specification documentation, implementers of COIL components should consider the following guidance:

### COIL Processor Implementation
- Start with a focus on a single architecture (e.g., x86-64 or ARM64)
- Implement the core instruction set first
- Add support for the virtual register system
- Expand to additional architectures

### Compiler Implementation
- Begin with a simple language to COIL translator
- Focus on primitive types and basic control flow
- Add optimization stages that leverage COIL's design
- Expand to support richer source languages

### Linker Implementation
- Implement basic NCOF processing capabilities
- Focus on single-architecture linking first
- Expand to cross-architecture support
- Add advanced features like link-time optimization

*Note: The COIL repository provides only specification documentation and does not include implementations, test suites, or development tools. Implementations based on this specification are encouraged as separate projects.*
