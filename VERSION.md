# Version Control

This document defines the versioning scheme for the COIL project. We follow a modified semantic versioning approach tailored to the needs of a low-level intermediate language.

## Versioning Format
COIL uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versioning scheme:

## Updating

### Major Version (X.0.0)
A major version change indicates substantial changes that break backward compatibility:
- Changes to the binary format
- Removal of deprecated features
- Significant modifications to core semantics
- Introduction of new mandatory features

All major releases must be thoroughly validated with the test suite and undergo a formal review process.

### Minor Version (0.X.0)
Minor version increases represent added functionality that maintains backward compatibility:
- New instructions
- Extended type support
- Additional directives
- Enhanced standard library functions

All minor releases must preserve binary compatibility with previous minor versions within the same major version.

### Patch Version (0.0.X)
Patch versions address bugs or clarify specifications without changing functionality:
- Bug fixes in reference implementations
- Documentation clarification
- Performance improvements
- Specification ambiguity resolution

## Compatibility Guarantees
- Binary compatibility is maintained within the same major version
- Patch versions never change behavior of correctly implemented code
- Minor versions may extend but never invalidate existing code

## Pre-1.0.0 Versioning
Prior to 1.0.0, the API is considered unstable and may change without major version increments. Version 0.x.y indicates development status where:
- x: Milestone or significant feature set completion
- y: Incremental improvements or fixes
