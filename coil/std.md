# COIL Standard Library (Future Implementation)

> **Important Note**: The standard library described in this document is planned for future versions of COIL (Version 2.0.0 and beyond). Version 1.0.0 of COIL focuses only on the core specification without standard library support. This document is part of the COIL specification documentation and does not contain implementation code.

The COIL Standard Library will provide a set of common functions and modules that can be used across different platforms. The library will be organized into levels of increasing complexity and platform dependence, allowing developers to choose the appropriate level for their specific needs.

## Library Structure

The future COIL Standard Library will be divided into three main levels:

1. **Simple Standard (SSTD)** - Level 1
   - Core functionality for all environments
   - Can be statically linked
   - No operating system dependencies
   - Suitable for embedded and bare-metal environments
   - Planned for introduction in Version 2.0.0

2. **Extended Standard (ESTD)** - Level 2
   - Extended functionality for operating system environments
   - Typically dynamically linked
   - Requires basic operating system features
   - Suitable for general application development
   - Planned for introduction in Version 2.1.0

3. **Graphics Standard (GSTD)** - Level 3
   - Graphics and user interface functionality
   - Requires display system support
   - Depends on operating system graphics capabilities
   - Suitable for application and game development
   - Planned for introduction in Version 2.2.0

## Library Versioning

The COIL Standard Library will use a year-based versioning scheme similar to C/C++ standards:

```
COIL-STD-YYYY[a-z]
```

For example:
- COIL-STD-2023a - Initial standard library release
- COIL-STD-2024a - First major update

Minor updates within a year will use letter suffixes (a, b, c, etc.).

## Level 0 - RAW

Level 0 is not technically part of the standard library but represents bare COIL code with no library dependencies. This level is supported in the COIL 1.0.0 specification and serves as the foundation for all COIL code.

Features of Level 0 (RAW) include:
- No standard library dependencies
- Direct hardware access where permitted by the platform
- Suitable for bare metal programming
- Minimal binary size
- Maximum control over system resources

## Implementation Timeline

The standard library development will occur according to the following timeline:

1. Version 2.0.0 of COIL: Introduction of Simple Standard (SSTD)
2. Version 2.1.0 of COIL: Introduction of Extended Standard (ESTD)
3. Version 2.2.0 of COIL: Introduction of Graphics Standard (GSTD)

## Anticipated SSTD Components (Version 2.0.0)

The Simple Standard library is expected to include:

1. **Memory Management**
   - Basic allocation and deallocation
   - Memory copy, move, and fill operations
   - Memory comparison utilities

2. **String Handling**
   - String comparison and manipulation
   - Character classification and conversion
   - Basic string parsing

3. **Basic I/O**
   - Minimal input/output abstractions
   - Stream-based interfaces where applicable
   - Device-independent I/O operations

4. **Data Structures**
   - Dynamic arrays
   - Linked lists
   - Hash tables
   - Binary trees

5. **Mathematics**
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Common mathematical functions
   - Random number generation
   - Fixed-point arithmetic for platforms without FPU

## Relation to Version 1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 of COIL deliberately omits standard library support to:
1. Establish a stable core specification first
2. Allow flexible implementation choices
3. Focus on the essential binary format and instruction set
4. Ensure minimal requirements for initial implementations

COIL code written for version 1.0.0 (Level 0) will remain compatible with future versions that include standard library support. The standard libraries will be designed as optional enhancements, not mandatory dependencies.

## Future Development

As the COIL specification evolves, the standard library will be expanded to include:

1. More comprehensive graphics and user interface capabilities
2. Multimedia support (audio, video)
3. Network protocol implementations
4. Database access
5. Parallel computing support
6. Advanced data structures and algorithms

These extensions will be defined in later specification versions.

## Implementation Guidance

While this repository contains only documentation and not implementation code, future implementers of the COIL standard library should consider:

1. Keeping dependencies minimal within each level
2. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility
3. Providing fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
4. Maintaining consistent APIs across platforms
5. Optimizing for both performance and size
6. Documenting extensions and platform-specific behaviors

## Conclusion

The COIL Standard Library, when implemented in future versions, will provide a comprehensive framework for developing portable applications across different architectures and platforms. Version 1.0.0 of COIL establishes the foundation upon which these libraries will be built.
