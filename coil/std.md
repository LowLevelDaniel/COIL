# COIL Standard Library (Future Implementation)

> **Important Note**: The standard library described in this document is planned for future versions of COIL (Version 2.0.0 and beyond). Version 1.0.0 of COIL will focus only on the core specification without standard library support.

The COIL Standard Library will provide a set of common functions and modules that can be used across different platforms. The library will be organized into levels of increasing complexity and platform dependence, allowing developers to choose the appropriate level for their specific needs.

## Library Structure

The future COIL Standard Library will be divided into three main levels:

1. **Simple Standard (SSTD)** - Level 1
   - Core functionality for all environments
   - Can be statically linked
   - No operating system dependencies
   - Suitable for embedded and bare-metal environments

2. **Extended Standard (ESTD)** - Level 2
   - Extended functionality for operating system environments
   - Typically dynamically linked
   - Requires basic operating system features
   - Suitable for general application development

3. **Graphics Standard (GSTD)** - Level 3
   - Graphics and user interface functionality
   - Requires display system support
   - Depends on operating system graphics capabilities
   - Suitable for application and game development

## Library Versioning

The COIL Standard Library will use a year-based versioning scheme similar to C/C++ standards:

```
COIL-STD-YYYY[a-z]
```

For example:
- COIL-STD-2023a - Initial standard library release
- COIL-STD-2024a - First major update

Minor updates within a year will use letter suffixes (a, b, c, etc.).

## Level 0 - RAW

Level 0 is not technically part of the standard library but represents bare COIL code with no library dependencies. This level is supported in the COIL 1.0.0 specification and serves as the foundation for all COIL code.

## Implementation Timeline

The standard library development will occur according to the following timeline:

1. Version 2.0.0 of COIL: Introduction of Simple Standard (SSTD)
2. Version 2.1.0 of COIL: Introduction of Extended Standard (ESTD)
3. Version 2.2.0 of COIL: Introduction of Graphics Standard (GSTD)

## Future Development

As the COIL specification evolves, the standard library will be expanded to include:

1. More comprehensive graphics and user interface capabilities
2. Multimedia support (audio, video)
3. Network protocol implementations
4. Database access
5. Parallel computing support
6. Advanced data structures and algorithms

These extensions will be defined in later specification versions.
