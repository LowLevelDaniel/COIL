# Standard Library
The standard library is versioned similar to the C/CXX standard library utilizing year dates to separate features with bulk expansions every couple of years. This library should be kept simple by being modular but expansive. All features should be able to be implemented but forcing users to have these bulky libraries installed could be annoying and difficult to manage. COIL assemblers should beware of this but not afraid. Implementing the latest standard is the duty of COIL assemblers to provide the developer with the most relxad programming experience and we will help you in this goal. Keeping functions minimal and expansions way smaller then CXX.
