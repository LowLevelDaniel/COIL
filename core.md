# COIL Core Principles

This document outlines the fundamental principles that guide the design and implementation of COIL.

## 1. Universal Feature Implementation

### Overview

One of COIL's most important features is its "all features implemented" approach. This principle ensures that every COIL instruction is available regardless of the underlying hardware's native capabilities.

### Implementation Details

- **CPU Configuration Analysis**: The COIL assembler uses the CPU configuration format to determine which features are natively supported.
- **Instruction Expansion**: When a COIL instruction doesn't have direct hardware support, the assembler automatically expands it into a sequence of supported instructions that achieve the same result.
- **Transparent Emulation**: Developers can use the full COIL instruction set without concern for hardware-specific limitations.

### Benefits

- **Write Once, Run Anywhere**: Code written in COIL maintains consistent behavior across different CPU architectures.
- **Forward Compatibility**: COIL code can leverage future hardware features automatically when compiled on newer architectures.
- **Simplified Development**: Developers don't need in-depth knowledge of architecture-specific limitations.

## 2. Bare Metal Operation with Optional OS Features

### Overview

COIL is designed to function at the bare metal level without dependencies, while still offering optional OS integration through its standard library.

### Implementation Details

- **No Required Runtime**: COIL does not depend on any runtime environment or operating system to execute.
- **Direct Hardware Access**: COIL provides mechanisms for direct hardware interaction when needed.
- **Optional Standard Library**: The COIL standard library provides OS abstractions that can be used when available.
- **Modular Integration**: OS features can be selectively included based on the target environment.

### Benefits

- **Maximum Flexibility**: COIL can be used for everything from bootloaders and firmware to full application development.
- **Controlled Abstraction**: Developers can choose their level of abstraction based on project requirements.

## 3. Assembly-Like Control with Abstractions

### Overview

COIL maintains the close-to-hardware nature of assembly while introducing key abstractions to simplify development.

### Implementation Details

- **Variable System**: COIL's variable system abstracts away register allocation and stack management, optimizing both at assemble time.
- **Type-Aware Operations**: Instructions are aware of data types based on the CPU configuration.
- **Transparent Register Allocation**: The assembler handles register allocation based on usage patterns and architecture capabilities.
- **Optimized Stack Usage**: Stack space is allocated efficiently based on variable lifetime analysis.

### Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: Developers don't need to manually manage registers and stack.
- **Improved Optimization**: The assembler can make more informed optimization decisions.
- **Architecture Independence**: Code doesn't depend on architecture-specific register sets.

## 4. Efficient Binary Format

### Overview

COIL uses a compact binary format designed for space efficiency and parsing optimization.

### Implementation Details

- **Optimized Encoding**: Instructions are encoded using a variable-length format that prioritizes common operations.
- **Metadata Compression**: Debugging and linking information is stored efficiently.
- **Direct Execution Format**: The binary format is designed for quick parsing and execution.
- **Separate Object Format**: COIL maintains distinct formats for intermediate code and native binaries, enabling additional link-time optimizations.

### Benefits

- **Reduced File Size**: COIL binaries are compact compared to traditional object files.
- **Fast Loading**: The format is designed for quick loading and parsing.
- **Efficient Linking**: The object format facilitates advanced link-time optimizations.

## 5. Assembly-Like Branching

### Overview

COIL maintains familiar assembly-like branching and comparison mechanisms using flags and labels.

### Implementation Details

- **Condition Flags**: COIL exposes condition flags similar to assembly languages.
- **Label-Based Jumps**: Branching uses labels that are resolved at assemble time.
- **Predicated Execution**: COIL supports predicated execution where available on the target architecture.
- **Branch Optimizations**: The assembler can perform branch-related optimizations like reordering and elimination.

### Benefits

- **Familiar Model**: Developers with assembly experience will find COIL's branching model intuitive.
- **Efficient Code Generation**: The direct mapping to hardware branching mechanisms enables efficient code generation.
- **Optimization Opportunities**: The explicit branching model provides clear optimization opportunities.

## 6. Cross-Device Support

### Overview

COIL is designed with a foundation for cross-device support, initially focusing on CPUs but with a path for expansion to other processing units.

### Implementation Details

- **Device Configuration Format**: Similar to the CPU configuration, other devices will have standardized configuration formats.
- **Standard Library Integration**: The standard library provides mechanisms for device switching and interaction.
- **Explicit Control**: Manual device switching is supported for bare metal environments.

### Benefits

- **Future Extensibility**: The COIL architecture can extend to GPUs, specialized accelerators, and other processing units.
- **Consistent Programming Model**: The same principles apply across different device types.
