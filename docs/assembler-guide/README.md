# COIL Assembler Creator Guide

This guide is for developers creating COIL assemblers - the tools that translate COIL binary code into native code for specific target architectures. As an assembler creator, your role is critical in the COIL ecosystem, forming the bridge between hardware-agnostic COIL code and optimized native code for specific processing units.

## Introduction for Assembler Creators

COIL assemblers are responsible for the final translation step in the COIL compilation pipeline. They take COIL binary code produced by compilers and generate efficient native code for specific target architectures. This separation of concerns allows compiler developers to focus on language semantics without needing detailed knowledge of target architectures.

## Key Responsibilities of Assembler Creators

1. **Target Configuration Management**: Define and manage target architecture specifications
2. **Instruction Implementation**: Map COIL instructions to native instructions
3. **Binary Translation**: Generate efficient native code from COIL binary
4. **Optimization Application**: Apply target-specific optimizations
5. **Hardware Feature Utilization**: Leverage specialized hardware capabilities
6. **Runtime Library Creation**: Develop runtime libraries for OS interactions (when needed)

## Basic Assembler Architecture

A typical COIL assembler has these components:

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
| COIL Binary      | --> | Binary Parser    | --> | Instruction      |
| Input            |     |                  |     | Decoder          |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
                                                          |
                                                          v
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
| Native Binary    | <-- | Native Code      | <-- | Target-Specific  |
| Output           |     | Generator        |     | Translator       |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
                              ^
                              |
+------------------+     +------------------+
| Target           | --> | Optimization     |
| Configuration    |     | Engine           |
+------------------+     +------------------+
```

## Getting Started

To begin developing a COIL assembler:

1. **Understand the COIL binary format**: Review the [Serialization Format Specification](../core-spec/serialization-format.md) to understand how COIL code is encoded.

2. **Learn the COIL instruction set**: Familiarize yourself with the [Instruction Set Reference](../core-spec/instruction-set.md) to understand what operations need to be implemented.

3. **Study the processing unit model**: Understand the [Processing Unit Model](../core-spec/processing-units.md) to know how COIL abstracts hardware capabilities.

4. **Define your target**: Create a target configuration that describes the architecture you're targeting.

5. **Implement instruction mapping**: Develop the mapping from COIL instructions to your target's native instructions.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Target Configuration System

Develop a system for defining and managing target configurations:
- Architecture specifications
- Feature sets
- Memory model details
- Processing unit characteristics

See [Target Configuration](target-configuration.md) for detailed guidance.

### 2. COIL Binary Parser

Create a parser for COIL binary format:
- Header parsing
- Section handling
- Instruction decoding
- Type system interpretation
- Relocation processing

### 3. Instruction Translator

Implement translation from COIL instructions to native instructions:
- Direct mappings where available
- Decomposition for complex instructions
- Specialization for target features
- Fallbacks for unsupported operations

See [Instruction Implementation](instruction-implementation.md) for detailed guidance.

### 4. Native Code Generator

Develop a component that produces native code:
- Instruction encoding
- Binary format generation
- Symbol resolution

See [Binary Translation](binary-translation.md) for detailed guidance.

### 5. Target-Specific Optimizer

Implement target-specific optimizations:
- Instruction selection
- Instruction scheduling
- Register allocation
- Memory access optimization
- Specialized hardware utilization

### 6. Runtime Library (Optional)

For environments with operating systems, create a runtime library:
- OS interface abstraction
- Memory management
- File and I/O operations
- Multi-threading support
- Error handling

## The Assembler Development Process

### 1. Target Definition

Begin by defining your target architecture:

```c
// Example target definition
target {
  "x86_64_avx2" {
    architecture = "x86_64"
    vendor = "generic"
    features = ["sse", "sse2", "sse3", "ssse3", "sse4.1", "sse4.2", 
                "avx", "avx2", "fma", "popcnt", "aes", "pclmul"]
    resources {
      registers = 16
      vector_width = 256  // AVX2 = 256-bit vectors
      min_alignment = 32
      memory_models = ["strong", "acquire_release", "relaxed"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Instruction Mapping

Define how COIL instructions map to your target's instructions:

```c
// Example instruction mapping (pseudocode)
void map_add_instruction(coil_instruction_t* instr, target_context_t* ctx) {
    operand_t dst = decode_operand(instr->operands[0], ctx);
    operand_t src1 = decode_operand(instr->operands[1], ctx);
    operand_t src2 = decode_operand(instr->operands[2], ctx);
    
    // Different mappings based on types
    if (is_integer_type(instr->type)) {
        emit_native_instruction(ctx, "ADD", dst, src1, src2);
    } else if (is_float_type(instr->type)) {
        emit_native_instruction(ctx, "FADD", dst, src1, src2);
    } else if (is_vector_type(instr->type)) {
        if (has_feature(ctx, "avx2")) {
            emit_native_instruction(ctx, "VADDPS", dst, src1, src2);
        } else {
            emit_native_instruction(ctx, "ADDPS", dst, src1, src2);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Optimization Implementation

Implement target-specific optimizations:

```c
// Example optimization (pseudocode)
void optimize_memory_access(instruction_sequence_t* seq, target_context_t* ctx) {
    // Look for load-store patterns that can be optimized
    for (int i = 0; i < seq->length - 1; i++) {
        if (seq->instructions[i].opcode == COIL_OP_LOAD &&
            seq->instructions[i+1].opcode == COIL_OP_STORE) {
            
            // Check if we can use a memory-to-memory instruction
            if (can_use_mem_to_mem(ctx)) {
                replace_with_mem_to_mem(&seq->instructions[i], 
                                       &seq->instructions[i+1], ctx);
                i++; // Skip the next instruction
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Native Code Generation

Generate the native code for your target:

```c
// Example native code generation (pseudocode)
void generate_native_code(module_t* module, target_context_t* ctx) {
    // Set up output file and sections
    binary_file_t binary = create_binary_file(ctx->output_format);
    
    // Process each function
    for (int i = 0; i < module->function_count; i++) {
        function_t* func = &module->functions[i];
        
        // Translate each COIL instruction to native
        for (int j = 0; j < func->instruction_count; j++) {
            instruction_t* instr = &func->instructions[j];
            translate_instruction(instr, &binary, ctx);
        }
    }
    
    // Finalize and write the binary
    finalize_binary(&binary);
    write_binary_file(&binary, ctx->output_path);
}
```
