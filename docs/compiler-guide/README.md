# COIL Compiler Developer Guide

This guide is for developers creating compilers, interpreters, or any frontend that generates COIL as a target. It provides an overview of the key considerations and best practices for targeting COIL effectively.

## Introduction for Compiler Developers

As a compiler developer, your primary task is to translate source language constructs into COIL's binary intermediate representation. The advantage of targeting COIL is that you can focus on language semantics and optimizations without worrying about the details of diverse target architectures.

Your compiler will generate COIL binary code, which COIL assemblers will then translate to native code for specific hardware targets.

## Key Responsibilities of Compiler Developers

1. **Type mapping**: Translate source language types to COIL's type system
2. **Instruction mapping**: Convert language constructs to COIL instructions
3. **Optimization**: Apply language-specific and general optimizations
4. **Serialization**: Generate correct COIL binary format
5. **Target specification**: Declare required target features and capabilities

## What Compiler Developers Don't Need to Worry About

When targeting COIL, you don't need to handle:

- Target-specific instruction selection
- Register allocation for specific architectures
- Memory alignment requirements of specific hardware
- Hardware-specific optimizations
- Device drivers or hardware interaction details

These concerns are handled by COIL assemblers, which translate your COIL code to native code for specific targets.

## Getting Started

To begin developing a compiler that targets COIL:

1. **Understand COIL's type system**: Review the [Type System Specification](../core-spec/type-system.md) to understand how to map your language's types to COIL.

2. **Learn the instruction set**: Familiarize yourself with the [COIL Instruction Set](../core-spec/instruction-set.md) to know what operations are available.

3. **Study the memory model**: Understand the [Memory Model](../core-spec/memory-model.md) to correctly handle your language's memory operations.

4. **Examine the serialization format**: Learn the [Binary Format Specification](../core-spec/serialization-format.md) to generate valid COIL binaries.

5. **Specify target requirements**: Understand the [Processing Unit Model](../core-spec/processing-units.md) to properly specify what capabilities your compiled code requires.

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Type Mapper

Develop a component that maps your language's types to COIL types. This includes:
- Primitive types (integers, floats, booleans)
- Composite types (arrays, structures, classes)
- Function types and signatures
- Pointer and reference types

See [Type Mapping](type-mapping.md) for detailed guidance.

### 2. Instruction Generator

Create a component that translates your language's operations to COIL instructions:
- Arithmetic operations
- Control flow (conditionals, loops)
- Function calls and returns
- Memory operations
- Special operations (vector, atomic, etc.)

See [Instruction Mapping](instruction-mapping.md) for detailed guidance.

### 3. Optimizer

Implement optimizations at the COIL level:
- Constant folding and propagation
- Dead code elimination
- Loop optimizations
- Inlining
- Specialized optimizations for your language

See [Optimization Hints](optimization-hints.md) for detailed guidance.

### 4. Serializer

Develop a component that outputs valid COIL binary:
- Create format headers
- Encode types and instructions
- Generate metadata and debugging information
- Ensure correct byte ordering and alignment

See [Serialization](serialization.md) for detailed guidance.

## Best Practices for Compiler Developers

### 1. Target Independence

Design your compiler to be target-independent. Avoid making assumptions about:
- Register count or types
- Cache sizes or memory hierarchies
- Specific instruction availability
- Hardware-specific features

Instead, express requirements through COIL's target specification mechanisms.

### 2. Feature Detection

Use COIL's feature detection mechanisms to support optional hardware features:
- Check for feature availability at compile time
- Provide fallback implementations for unsupported features
- Generate appropriate feature requirements in COIL binary

### 3. Optimization Levels

Support multiple optimization levels in your compiler:
- Development/debugging (minimal optimization)
- Standard optimization (balance of compile time and performance)
- Aggressive optimization (maximum performance)
- Size optimization (minimal code size)

### 4. Debugging Support

Generate appropriate debugging information in your COIL binary:
- Source location mapping
- Variable information
- Type descriptions
- Function boundaries

### 5. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in your compiler:
- Validate all COIL operations before generation
- Provide clear error messages for invalid operations
- Check for type mismatches and unsupported features

## Testing Your Compiler

Test your compiler's COIL output by:

1. Using COIL validation tools to verify your binary format
2. Testing with multiple COIL assemblers to ensure portability
3. Running on diverse target architectures to verify correctness
4. Comparing performance against direct native compilation
5. Checking generated code size and efficiency
