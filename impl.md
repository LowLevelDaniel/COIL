# COIL Implementation Report

## Introduction

This report details the design and implementation of the Computer Oriented Intermediate Language (COIL), a low-level intermediate representation designed to replace traditional assembly languages while providing superior support for cross-architecture and cross-processing unit development. COIL bridges the gap between high-level programming languages and machine code, offering precise control over hardware capabilities while maintaining a consistent programming model.

## Design Philosophy and Goals

The creation of COIL was driven by several core design principles:

1. **Architecture Independence**: Provide a unified programming model that works across diverse hardware architectures without sacrificing performance.

2. **Close to Metal Performance**: Maintain the efficiency and control of assembly language while adding abstractions that enable optimization and portability.

3. **Explicit Control**: Give programmers explicit control over hardware resources and execution when needed, avoiding hidden behaviors.

4. **Optimization-Friendly**: Enable sophisticated compile-time and link-time optimizations that exceed what's possible with traditional assembly.

5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Design a system that can function with minimal external dependencies, making it suitable for embedded systems and bare-metal programming.

6. **Documentation-Driven**: Create a well-documented system where specifications are precise and comprehensive.

## Key Innovations

COIL introduces several innovative features that distinguish it from traditional assembly languages:

### 1. C-Structure-Based Configuration System

The most significant innovation in COIL is its comprehensive, C-structure-based configuration system. This system:

- Defines detailed capability bitfields for each target architecture
- Replaces traditional instruction set variants with capability-aware operations
- Enables precise control over instruction selection and optimization
- Facilitates automatic cross-architecture code generation

By moving architecture-specific details to the configuration, COIL achieves a clean separation between the programming model and the implementation details.

### 2. Variable and Type System

COIL's variable system provides:

- Explicit type information for all variables
- Structured data definitions within section declarations
- Natural integration with the target's register allocation system
- Optimization opportunities through lifecycle analysis

This system eliminates the need for manual register allocation while maintaining precise control over data representation.

### 3. Function and ABI System

The function and ABI system offers:

- Explicit ABI definitions in the configuration
- Function boundaries with clear parameter and return value handling
- Cross-architecture function calls with automatic conversion
- Support for heterogeneous computing environments

### 4. Target Switching

COIL's target switching capability enables:

- Multiple architecture sections within a single source file
- Seamless transitions between CPU, GPU, and other processing units
- Automatic data transfer between memory spaces
- Polyglot binaries that run efficiently on multiple architectures

### 5. Directives and Section Management

The directive system provides:

- Explicit control over code and data organization
- Clear separation between different memory regions
- Direct communication with the COIL linker
- Optimization hints without forcing specific implementations

## Implementation Approach

The COIL system consists of several key components:

### 1. COIL Assembler

The COIL assembler translates COIL source code into either COIL Object Format (COF) or Native Object Format (NOF):

- Parses COIL source code and directives
- Validates operations against target capabilities
- Performs architecture-specific optimizations
- Generates efficient machine code for the target architecture

### 2. COIL Linker

The COIL linker combines multiple COIL objects into executable code:

- Resolves cross-module references
- Performs whole-program optimization
- Handles cross-architecture linking
- Generates final executable formats

### 3. COIL Debugger

The COIL debugger provides source-level debugging for COIL programs:

- Maps between COIL source and machine code
- Supports debugging across architecture boundaries
- Provides visibility into register and memory state
- Works with standard debugging protocols

### 4. COIL Standard Library

The standard library provides a consistent interface across different target environments:

- Core memory and string operations
- System call interfaces for different operating systems
- Hardware abstraction for common devices
- Cross-architecture communication primitives

## Configuration System Details

The most significant aspect of COIL's design is its configuration system, which replaces traditional instruction set definitions with a capability-based approach:

### Capability-Based Instruction Selection

Instead of defining separate instruction variants for different data types, COIL uses a capability system:

1. Each target architecture defines capability bitfields for different instruction categories:
   - Integer operations
   - Floating-point operations
   - Vector/SIMD operations
   - Control flow operations
   - Memory operations

2. The assembler consults these capability flags to determine:
   - Whether an operation is supported
   - How to optimally implement it
   - What constraints apply

3. This approach enables a unified programming model while still generating optimal code for each target.

### Register Representation

The configuration system defines:

1. Available physical registers on each target
2. Register properties (size, aliasing, partial access)
3. Virtual register mappings
4. Special-purpose registers

This enables consistent register usage across architectures while still allowing architecture-specific optimizations.

### ABI and Syscall Configuration

The configuration explicitly defines:

1. Function calling conventions for each supported ABI
2. Parameter passing strategies
3. Return value handling
4. Register preservation rules
5. System call interfaces

By making these conventions explicit in the configuration, COIL ensures consistent behavior across architectures.

## Key Design Decisions

During the development of COIL, several key design decisions shaped the system:

### 1. Object Format Design

Creating a specialized Native Object Format (NOF) instead of using existing formats like ELF or PE:

- Pros: Better support for heterogeneous computing, cross-architecture linkage
- Cons: Requires custom tooling, not directly compatible with existing tools

### 2. Explicit Configuration Over Implicit Behavior

Making architecture-specific behavior explicit in the configuration:

- Pros: Transparency, predictability, easier debugging
- Cons: More verbose configuration, increased learning curve

### 3. Directive-Based Section Management

Using directives for section management instead of high-level abstractions:

- Pros: Direct control, compatibility with existing assembly practices
- Cons: More verbose than high-level constructs

### 4. C-Structure-Based Configuration Format

Using a C-structure format for configuration:

- Pros: Precise, programmatically processable, familiar to low-level programmers
- Cons: More verbose than some alternative formats

## Use Cases and Examples
