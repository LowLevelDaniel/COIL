# COIL Implementation Guide

This guide provides directions for implementing the COIL language based on the provided header files. It covers the key components, their relationships, and implementation strategies.

## Architecture Overview

The COIL implementation consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Core Language**
   - Types and values
   - Instructions
   - Scopes and lifetime management

2. **Target Backend**
   - Architecture-specific code generation
   - Register and stack allocation
   - Feature implementation (native and emulated)

3. **Object Format**
   - COIL object file generation
   - Symbol and relocation handling

## Implementing Core Components

### Value System

The value system is central to COIL. Implementation requires:

1. **Value Representation**
   - Internal storage for different value categories
   - Type information management
   - Flag handling

2. **Value Lifetime Management**
   - Creation and destruction of values
   - Association with scopes
   - Resource tracking

Example implementation approach:

```c
struct coil_internal_value {
  coil_value_t public_value;
  coil_scope_t* owner_scope;
  uint32_t reference_count;
  union {
    // Architecture-specific storage information
    struct {
      uint32_t register_id;
      bool is_allocated;
    } register_storage;
    struct {
      uint32_t stack_offset;
      uint32_t alignment;
    } stack_storage;
    // Other storage types
  } storage;
};
```

### Scope Management

Scope management requires:

1. **Scope Hierarchy**
   - Parent-child relationships
   - Scope entry and exit handling

2. **Value Tracking**
   - Association of values with scopes
   - Automatic cleanup on scope exit

Example implementation approach:

```c
struct coil_internal_scope {
  coil_scope_t public_scope;
  coil_internal_value** values;
  uint32_t value_count;
  uint32_t value_capacity;
  struct coil_internal_scope** children;
  uint32_t child_count;
  uint32_t child_capacity;
};
```

### Instruction Handling

Instruction handling requires:

1. **Instruction Representation**
   - Operation type
   - Operand management

2. **Instruction Execution**
   - Mapping to target architecture instructions
   - Operand location handling

Example implementation approach:

```c
struct coil_internal_instruction {
  coil_instruction_t public_instruction;
  uint32_t sequence_number;
  coil_internal_scope* owner_scope;
};
```

## Target Backend Implementation

Implementing a target backend requires:

1. **Register Allocation**
   - Mapping COIL values to architecture registers
   - Register usage tracking
   - Spill handling

2. **Stack Management**
   - Frame layout
   - Alignment handling
   - Parameter passing

3. **Instruction Selection**
   - Mapping COIL instructions to target instructions

4. **Feature Implementation**
   - Native implementation of supported features
   - Emulation of unsupported features

Example target backend structure:

```c
typedef struct {
  // Target identification
  coil_target_arch_t arch;
  coil_target_proc_t proc;
  
  // Target capabilities
  uint64_t native_capabilities;
  uint32_t register_count;
  uint32_t register_size;
    
  // Function map for operation implementations
  coil_function_map_t* function_map;
} coil_target_backend_t;
```

## Function Map Implementation

The function map approach is used to select between native and emulated implementations of COIL features:

```c
typedef coil_status_t (*coil_function_map_entry_t)(void* context, void* args);

typedef struct {
  // ...
  coil_function_map_entry_t add;
  coil_function_map_entry_t addeq;
  // ...
  uint32_t entry_count;
} coil_function_map_t;
```

The compiler initializes the appropriate function map based on the target architecture and its capabilities. When generating code for a COIL operation, it simply calls the function pointer as it will always point to valid functino weather that is the emulated feature or the native feature is not important.

```c
target->function_map->add(dest, src1, src2);
target->function_map->addeq(dest, src1);
```

This approach allows COIL to provide consistent behavior across all targets while still taking advantage of hardware acceleration when available.

## Advanced Operations Implementation

All COIL operations (including SIMD, atomics, crypto, etc.) are native features, but their implementation may differ based on the target:

The important aspect is that the COIL API remains the same regardless of how the operation is implemented. The user never needs to know whether a feature is implemented natively or emulated.

## Object Format Implementation

Implementing the COIL object format requires:

1. **File Structure**
   - Header generation
   - Section management
   - String table handling

2. **Symbol Management**
   - Symbol table creation
   - Symbol resolution
   - Visibility handling

3. **Relocation Handling**
   - Relocation entry generation
   - Relocation types
   - Address calculation

Example object format implementation approach:

```c
typedef struct {
  // File management
  FILE* file;
  const char* filename;
  
  // Object structure
  coil_object_header_t header;
  coil_section_header_t* sections;
  uint32_t section_count;
  
  // Symbol management
  coil_symbol_t* symbols;
  uint32_t symbol_count;
  char* string_table;
  uint32_t string_table_size;
  
  // Relocation information
  coil_relocation_t** relocations;
  uint32_t* relocation_counts;
} coil_object_context_t;
```

## Optimization
Optimizations are not important at this early of a stage but will optimize the given COIL opcode into optimized COIL opcode and then ask the writer to write the optimzied COIL opcode.
