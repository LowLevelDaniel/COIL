# COIL Optimization Specification

## 1. Introduction

The COIL Optimization specification defines the compile-time strategies, techniques, and annotations for optimizing COIL code across diverse processing units. This document focuses on static optimizations performed during compilation, enabling efficient execution without runtime overhead, making it suitable for bare-metal environments like bootloaders and UEFI applications, while still supporting advanced workloads.

## 2. Compile-Time Optimization Framework

### 2.1 Static Optimization Pipeline

COIL defines a multi-stage compile-time optimization pipeline:

```
Source Code → IR Generation → Analysis → Transformation → Code Generation
```

Each stage includes various optimization passes performed entirely during compilation:

1. **IR Generation**: Initial optimizations during IR creation
2. **Analysis**: Static data gathering for optimization decisions
3. **Transformation**: Static code-modifying optimizations
4. **Code Generation**: Target-specific optimizations

### 2.2 Optimization Levels

COIL defines standard compile-time optimization levels:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | None | No optimization (for debugging) |
| 1 | Basic | Basic optimizations (fast compilation) |
| 2 | Standard | Standard optimizations (default) |
| 3 | Aggressive | Aggressive optimizations (slower compilation) |
| 4 | Extreme | Maximum optimization (very slow compilation) |
| s | Size | Optimize for code size (critical for firmware) |
| g | Debug | Optimizations that preserve debug information |

### 2.3 Optimization Control

COIL provides mechanisms to control static optimization:

```
OPT_LEVEL level
OPT_ENABLE pass_name
OPT_DISABLE pass_name
OPT_PARAMETER pass_name, parameter, value
```

These directives guide the compiler's optimization process and are processed entirely at compile time.

## 3. Static Optimization Annotations

### 3.1 Function Annotations

Function-level compile-time optimization annotations:

```
FUNCTION_ATTR function, attribute
```

Common function attributes for static optimization:
- `INLINE`: Function should be inlined during compilation
- `NOINLINE`: Function should not be inlined
- `PURE`: Function has no side effects (enables more optimization)
- `CONST`: Function return value depends only on arguments
- `HOT`: Function is frequently executed (prioritize optimization)
- `COLD`: Function is rarely executed (deprioritize optimization)
- `NORETURN`: Function does not return
- `FLATTEN`: All calls inside function should be inlined
- `OPTIMIZE(level)`: Function-specific optimization level
- `SECTION("name")`: Place function in specific binary section

### 3.2 Loop Annotations

Loop-specific static optimization annotations:

```
LOOP_ATTR loop_id, attribute
```

Common loop attributes:
- `UNROLL(factor)`: Statically unroll loop by factor
- `NOUNROLL`: Do not unroll loop
- `VECTORIZE`: Vectorize loop during compilation
- `NOVECTORIZE`: Do not vectorize loop
- `DISTRIBUTE`: Distribute loop into multiple loops
- `INTERCHANGE`: Allow loop interchange during compilation
- `TILE(x,y)`: Tile loop with dimensions x,y
- `INVARIANT(expr)`: Expression is loop invariant

### 3.3 Data Annotations

Data-related static optimization annotations:

```
DATA_ATTR variable, attribute
```

Common data attributes:
- `ALIGN(bytes)`: Align data to specified boundary at compile time
- `RESTRICT`: Pointer does not alias (enables more optimization)
- `READONLY`: Data is only read, never written
- `WRITEONLY`: Data is only written, never read
- `NOINIT`: Data does not need initialization
- `CACHELINE_ALIGN`: Align to cache line boundary
- `PACKED`: Pack data structure tightly
- `SECTION("name")`: Place data in specific binary section
