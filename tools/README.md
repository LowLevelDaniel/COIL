# COIL Instruction Set Architecture

## Overview

COIL (Cross-architecture Optimizing Instruction Layer) is a unified instruction set abstraction designed to support code generation across diverse CPU architectures. Unlike traditional ISAs that are tied to specific hardware, COIL provides a hardware-agnostic representation that can be mapped to various target architectures including x86, ARM, RISC-V, PowerPC, MIPS, SPARC, WebAssembly, and various microcontrollers.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive reference for the COIL ISA, providing details on its design, structure, capabilities, and implementation.

## Design Philosophy

COIL is built on several key principles:

1. **Architecture Neutrality**: Instructions are defined by their semantic meaning rather than by hardware-specific implementation details, allowing code to be portable across diverse architectures.

2. **Capability-Based**: Runtime decisions use capability structures that describe what operations a target CPU can perform efficiently. This allows for optimized code generation tailored to specific hardware features.

3. **Unified Representation**: A single consistent representation is used regardless of the target architecture, simplifying tools and analyses that operate on COIL code.

4. **Extensibility**: The system can be extended to support new architectures, processing unit types, and instruction capabilities without breaking existing code.

5. **Minimal Dependencies**: The core COIL implementation has minimal external dependencies, relying primarily on standard C libraries to ensure maximum portability.

6. **Performance-Oriented**: The design prioritizes efficient execution and optimization opportunities over simplicity when necessary.

## Version Information

COIL uses semantic versioning to track changes:

```c
#define COIL_VERSION_MAJOR 1    // Incompatible API changes
#define COIL_VERSION_MINOR 1    // Backwards-compatible functionality
#define COIL_VERSION_PATCH 0    // Backwards-compatible bug fixes
```

Current version: 1.1.0

## Processing Unit Types

COIL is designed to eventually support different types of processing units:

```c
typedef enum coil_pu_type {
  COIL_PU_CPU,                     /**< Central Processing Unit */
  COIL_PU_GPU,                     /**< Graphics Processing Unit */
  COIL_PU_DSP,                     /**< Digital Signal Processor */
  COIL_PU_NPU,                     /**< Neural Processing Unit */
  COIL_PU_TPU,                     /**< Tensor Processing Unit */
  COIL_PU_FPGA,                    /**< Field-Programmable Gate Array */
  COIL_PU_ASIC,                    /**< Application-Specific Integrated Circuit */
} coil_pu_type_t;
```

This documentation primarily focuses on the CPU implementation, as it is the most mature part of the COIL system.

## Supported CPU Architectures

  ISA_CPU_REG_ACC = 0x0E      /**< Accumulator registers */
} coil_cpu_reg_t;
```

## Data Types

## Qualifiers

Qualifiers provide additional context for operands:

```c
typedef enum coil_qual : uint8_t {
  COIL_QUAL_NULL = (1 << 0),      /**< Null/empty qualifier */
  COIL_QUAL_IMM = (1 << 1),       /**< Immediate value */
  COIL_QUAL_VAR = (1 << 2),       /**< Variable reference */
  COIL_QUAL_SYMB = (1 << 3),      /**< Symbolic reference */
  COIL_QUAL_VREG = (1 << 4),      /**< Virtual register reference */
  COIL_QUAL_VOLATILE = (1 << 5),  /**< Volatile access */
  COIL_QUAL_ATOMIC = (1 << 6),    /**< Atomic access */
  COIL_QUAL_SIGNED = (1 << 7),    /**< Signed interpretation */
} coil_qual_t;
```

## Instruction Encoding

COIL instructions use a flexible encoding format designed for both in-memory representation and serialization:

```
[opcode: uint16_t][operand count: uint8_t][[operand]...]
[operand] = [type: uint8_t][qualifier: uint8_t][data: void[]]
```

### Opcode (16 bits)

The opcode is a 16-bit identifier that specifies the operation to be performed. Opcodes are organized into functional categories such as control flow, memory operations, and arithmetic.

### Operand Count (8 bits)

An 8-bit value indicating how many operands follow the instruction header.

### Operands (Variable Length)

Each operand consists of:
- **Type** (8-bit): Specifies the data type (e.g., int32, fp64, vec128)
- **Qualifier** (8-bit): Provides additional information about the operand (e.g., immediate, variable, register)
- **Data**: Variable-length data associated with the operand

## Instruction Categories

COIL instructions are organized into the following major categories:

### Control Flow Instructions (ISA_CF_*)

Control flow instructions manage the execution path of a program, including branches, calls, and returns. The comprehensive list includes:

```c
typedef enum coil_isa : uint16_t {
  // Control Flow
  ISA_CF_BRANCH = 0x01   , /**< Branch/jump */
  ISA_CF_BRANCH_COND     , /**< Conditional branch */
  ISA_CF_CALL            , /**< Call subroutine */
  ISA_CF_RET             , /**< Return from subroutine */
  ISA_CF_JUMP_REG        , /**< Jump to register */
  ISA_CF_BRANCH_INDIRECT , /**< Indirect branch */
  ISA_CF_BRANCH_PREDICT  , /**< Branch prediction hints */
  // ... (many more control flow instructions)
} coil_isa_t;
```

Key control flow instructions include:
- **ISA_CF_BRANCH**: Unconditional branch/jump to a target address
- **ISA_CF_BRANCH_COND**: Conditional branch based on a test condition
- **ISA_CF_CALL**: Call a subroutine, saving the return address
- **ISA_CF_RET**: Return from a subroutine
- **ISA_CF_JUMP_REG**: Jump to an address stored in a register
- **ISA_CF_TRAP**: Generate a trap or system call
- **ISA_CF_PRED_EXECUTION**: Enable predicated execution

### Memory Operations (ISA_MEM_*)

Memory operations handle interactions with the memory subsystem, including loads, stores, and synchronization.

Key memory operations include:
- **ISA_MEM_LOAD**: Load data from memory into a register
- **ISA_MEM_STORE**: Store data from a register into memory
- **ISA_MEM_PREFETCH**: Prefetch memory into cache
- **ISA_MEM_FENCE**: Create a memory barrier for synchronization
- **ISA_MEM_EXCHANGE**: Atomically exchange values
- **ISA_MEM_PUSH**: Push a value onto the stack
- **ISA_MEM_POP**: Pop a value from the stack

Different memory ordering models are supported:
- **ISA_MEM_SYNC_ACQUIRE**: Acquire semantics (prevents later loads from being reordered before this operation)
- **ISA_MEM_SYNC_RELEASE**: Release semantics (prevents earlier stores from being reordered after this operation)
- **ISA_MEM_SYNC_ACQREL**: Combined acquire-release semantics
- **ISA_MEM_SYNC_SC**: Sequential consistency (strongest memory ordering guarantee)

### Basic Arithmetic (ISA_BMATH_*)

Basic arithmetic operations perform fundamental mathematical computations.

Key arithmetic operations include:
- **ISA_BMATH_ADD**: Addition
- **ISA_BMATH_SUB**: Subtraction
- **ISA_BMATH_MUL**: Multiplication
- **ISA_BMATH_DIV**: Division
- **ISA_BMATH_REM**: Remainder (modulo)
- **ISA_BMATH_NEG**: Negation
- **ISA_BMATH_ABS**: Absolute value
- **ISA_BMATH_MULADD**: Combined multiply-add operation (a*b+c)

### Bit Manipulation (ISA_BIT_*)

Bit manipulation instructions operate on individual bits or bit patterns.

Key bit manipulation operations include:
- **ISA_BIT_AND**: Bitwise AND
- **ISA_BIT_OR**: Bitwise OR

COIL facilitates cross-architecture code generation through a multi-stage process:

1. **Target Configuration**: A `coil_cpu_t` structure is populated with information about the target architecture.

2. **COIL IR Generation**: High-level code is lowered to COIL IR (Intermediate Representation), which uses the architecture-neutral instruction set.

3. **Capability Querying**: The code generator queries the target configuration to determine what features are available.

4. **Instruction Selection**: Based on the target capabilities, appropriate instruction sequences are selected.

5. **Register Allocation**: Virtual registers in the COIL IR are mapped to physical registers on the target architecture.

6. **Memory Layout**: Memory operations are adjusted based on the target's addressing modes and alignment requirements.

7. **Optimization**: Architecture-specific optimizations are applied based on the target's execution model and performance characteristics.

8. **Code Emission**: The final machine code is generated for the target architecture.

### Target-Specific Optimization

COIL enables various target-specific optimizations:

- **Instruction Selection**: Choose the most efficient instructions based on the target's capabilities.
- **Register Allocation**: Optimize register usage based on the target's register file.
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Adjust memory access patterns based on the target's cache hierarchy and prefetch capabilities.
- **Vectorization**: Leverage vector instructions when available.
- **Specialized Instructions**: Use specialized instructions (e.g., FMA, population count) when supported.

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing COIL, consider the following:

### Memory Management

- Ensure proper alignment of data structures, especially for vector types.
- Be aware of the target's memory ordering model and use appropriate barriers.
- Consider cache-friendly data layout to maximize performance.

### Register Allocation

- Respect the target's register file size and constraints.
- Consider register pressure when generating code.
- Use spilling to memory when necessary, but try to minimize it.

### Instruction Selection

- Prefer instructions that map directly to the target architecture when possible.
- Fall back to instruction sequences for operations not directly supported.
- Consider the performance characteristics of different instruction choices.

### Error Handling

- Validate instruction operands against the target's capabilities.
- Provide meaningful error messages when an operation is not supported.
- Consider graceful fallbacks for unsupported operations.

## Future Directions

COIL is designed to be extensible and will continue to evolve to support new architectures, instruction sets, and processing unit types. Planned extensions include:

- **GPU Support**: Expanded capabilities for GPU code generation.
- **Neural Accelerators**: Support for specialized neural network accelerators.
- **Heterogeneous Computing**: Improved support for code generation across different processing unit types.
- **Dynamic Code Generation**: JIT compilation capabilities.
- **Optimization Framework**: A pluggable optimization framework for target-specific optimizations.

## Conclusion

COIL provides a powerful abstraction for cross-architecture code generation, enabling portable, optimized code across a wide range of target architectures. By separating the semantic meaning of operations from their hardware-specific implementation, COIL allows for flexible, efficient code generation that leverages the unique capabilities of each target platform.
